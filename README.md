# Confidential Solana Token Example

This project demonstrates how to use Solana's SPL Token 2022 program with the Confidential Transfer extension, enabling private token transfers using zero-knowledge proofs. The code is written in Rust and uses the Solana and SPL Token client libraries.

## Features
- **Create a confidential mint**: Deploy a new SPL Token mint with the Confidential Transfer extension enabled.
- **Create confidential token accounts**: Set up token accounts for users (e.g., Alice and Bob) with confidential transfer capabilities.
- **Mint tokens**: Mint tokens to a confidential token account.
- **Deposit tokens confidentially**: Move tokens into a confidential (private) balance using zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Confidential transfer**: Privately transfer tokens between accounts without revealing the amount on-chain.
- **Apply pending balances**: Move deposited tokens from a pending state to an available confidential balance.

## How It Works
1. **Setup**: Connects to a local Solana RPC node and generates keypairs for users.
2. **Mint Creation**: Creates a new token mint with confidential transfer enabled.
3. **Account Creation**: Sets up confidential token accounts for each user, generating the necessary cryptographic keys.
4. **Minting**: Mints tokens to a user's confidential token account.
5. **Deposit**: Deposits tokens into the confidential balance (pending, then available).
6. **Confidential Transfer**: Transfers tokens privately from one user to another using zero-knowledge proofs.

## Confidential Pending and Available Accounts
When you deposit tokens into a confidential token account, the tokens first go into a **pending balance**. This means the tokens are not immediately available for spendingâ€”they are waiting to be confirmed and applied. After the deposit, you must perform an additional step to "apply" the pending balance, which moves the tokens into the **available balance**. 

Only tokens in the available balance can be used for confidential transfers or withdrawals. This two-step process helps ensure privacy and security in confidential token operations.

## Confidential Token Account Cycle

This cycle allows for seamless movement between public and confidential states, supporting privacy-preserving transactions while maintaining compatibility with public token systems. Each stage is crucial for ensuring both privacy and flexibility in managing digital assets.


## File Structure
- `src/main.rs`: Main entry point. Orchestrates the confidential mint, account creation, minting, deposit, and transfer steps.
- `src/helper.rs`: Helper functions for keypair generation, transaction handling, and account inspection.
- `src/confidential/`: Contains modules for each confidential token operation:
  - `confidential_mint.rs`: Create a confidential mint.
  - `confidential_token_account.rs`: Create confidential token accounts.
  - `confidential_deposit_token.rs`: Deposit tokens confidentially.
  - `confidential_transfer_tokens.rs`: Confidential token transfer logic.
  - `apply_pending_balance.rs`: Apply pending confidential balances.
  - `confidential_withdraw_tokens.rs`: (Stub for future withdrawal logic.)

## Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain
- Solana CLI and local validator running (`solana-test-validator`)
- The required Solana and SPL Token 2022 Rust crates

## Running the Example
1. Start a local Solana validator:
   ```sh
   solana-test-validator
   ```
2. Build and run the project:
   ```sh
   cd confidential-solana
   cargo run
   ```

You should see logs for each step: mint creation, account setup, minting, deposit, and confidential transfer.

## Problems I Have Faced

| Problem                                                                 | Reason                                                                                      | Solution                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unable to find proper reference for building confidential program using Anchor and no JS SDK for testing | Lack of documentation and SDK support for confidential programs with Anchor and JS           | After spending a couple of days, started building from the client side using the `spl-token-2022` crate          |
| Unable to create confidential token account                             | `spl-token-2022` is not supported by the default local validator                            | Manually installed the mainnet validator and then started creating confidential token accounts                   |


## Notes
- This example is for educational purposes and uses insecure keypair generation for demonstration.
- The confidential transfer feature relies on zero-knowledge proofs and special cryptographic keys (ElGamal, AES).
- Withdraw logic is stubbed and can be implemented similarly to deposit/apply logic.
