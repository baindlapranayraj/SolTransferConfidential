# Confidential Solana Token Example

This project demonstrates how to use Solana's SPL Token 2022 program with the Confidential Transfer extension, enabling private token transfers using zero-knowledge proofs. The code is written in Rust and uses the Solana and SPL Token client libraries.

# What is Confidential Tokens
Confidential tokens on Solana are special tokens that allow you to transfer amounts privately. While the token account addresses are public, the actual token balances and transfer amounts are hidden using encryption and cryptography. Only you (and optionally an **auditor**) know your balance, but you can still send and receive tokens securely and privately.

# What is ZK Proofs ?
Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic tools that let you prove something is true without revealing the underlying secret. In confidential token transfers, they let you prove the transfer is valid without revealing the amount or sensitive account details.

## ElGamal Encryption in Confidential Transfers 
ElGamal encryption is a public-key cryptography system used in Solana's confidential token transfers to keep token amounts private. Each confidential token account generates its own ElGamal keypair (a public and private key). When tokens are transferred or deposited confidentially, the amounts are encrypted using the recipient's ElGamal public key. Only the account owner, who holds the corresponding private key, can decrypt and view the actual token balance.

This encryption ensures that:
- The transaction amounts remain hidden from everyone except the intended recipient.
- Zero-knowledge proofs are used to prove the validity of transactions without revealing the actual amounts.
- The system maintains privacy while still allowing the blockchain to verify that all operations are correct and secure.

In summary, ElGamal encryption is a core part of how confidential transfers work, enabling privacy-preserving transactions on Solana.


## Features
- **Create a confidential mint**: Deploy a new SPL Token mint with the Confidential Transfer extension enabled.
- **Create confidential token accounts**: Set up token accounts for users (e.g., Alice and Bob) with confidential transfer capabilities.
- **Mint tokens**: Mint tokens to a confidential token account.
- **Deposit tokens confidentially**: Move tokens into a confidential (private) balance using zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Confidential transfer**: Privately transfer tokens between accounts without revealing the amount on-chain.
- **Apply pending balances**: Move deposited tokens from a pending state to an available confidential balance.



## How It Works
1. **Setup**: Connects to a local Solana RPC node and generates keypairs for users.
2. **Mint Creation**: Creates a new token mint with confidential transfer enabled.
3. **Account Creation**: Sets up confidential token accounts for each user, generating the necessary cryptographic keys.
4. **Minting**: Mints tokens to a user's confidential token account.
5. **Deposit**: Deposits tokens into the confidential balance (pending, then available).
6. **Confidential Transfer**: Transfers tokens privately from one user to another using zero-knowledge proofs.

## Confidential Pending and Available Accounts
When you deposit tokens into a confidential token account, the tokens first go into a **pending balance**. This means the tokens are not immediately available for spendingâ€”they are waiting to be confirmed and applied. After the deposit, you must perform an additional step to "apply" the pending balance, which moves the tokens into the **available balance**. 

Only tokens in the available balance can be used for confidential transfers or withdrawals. This two-step process helps ensure privacy and security in confidential token operations.

## Confidential Token Account Cycle

This cycle allows for seamless movement between public and confidential states, supporting privacy-preserving transactions while maintaining compatibility with public token systems. Each stage is crucial for ensuring both privacy and flexibility in managing digital assets.


## File Structure
- `src/main.rs`: Main entry point. Orchestrates the confidential mint, account creation, minting, deposit, and transfer steps.
- `src/helper.rs`: Helper functions for keypair generation, transaction handling, and account inspection.
- `src/confidential/`: Contains modules for each confidential token operation:
  - `confidential_mint.rs`: Create a confidential mint.
  - `confidential_token_account.rs`: Create confidential token accounts.
  - `confidential_deposit_token.rs`: Deposit tokens confidentially.
  - `confidential_transfer_tokens.rs`: Confidential token transfer logic.
  - `apply_pending_balance.rs`: Apply pending confidential balances.
  - `confidential_withdraw_tokens.rs`: (Stub for future withdrawal logic.)

## Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain
- Solana CLI and local validator running (`solana-test-validator`)
- The required Solana and SPL Token 2022 Rust crates

## Running the Example
1. Start a local Solana validator:
   ```sh
   solana-test-validator
   ```
2. Build and run the project:
   ```sh
   cd confidential-solana
   cargo run
   ```

You should see logs for each step: mint creation, account setup, minting, deposit, and confidential transfer.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unable to find proper reference for building confidential program using Anchor and no JS SDK for testing | Lack of documentation and SDK support for confidential programs with Anchor and JS           | After spending a couple of days, started building from the client side using the `spl-token-2022` crate          |
| Unable to create confidential token account                             | `spl-token-2022` is not supported by the default local validator                            | Manually installed the mainnet validator and then started creating confidential token accounts                   |


## Notes
- This example is for educational purposes and uses insecure keypair generation for demonstration.
- The confidential transfer feature relies on zero-knowledge proofs and special cryptographic keys (ElGamal, AES).
- Withdraw logic is stubbed and can be implemented similarly to deposit/apply logic.
